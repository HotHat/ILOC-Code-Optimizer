The program improves the running time of a set of test codes presented in a subset of the ILOC intermediate form, specifically, the program
- Scan and parse the ILOC code
- Build an internal representation for the ILOC code
- Perform both loop unrolling and value numbering
- Print the transformed ILOC code in a form that can be read and executed by the ILOC simulator.

————————————————————————————
Please use Makefile to build the program.
To execute the optimizer:
bash execute.sh
then follow the instructions to choose one optimization strategy
0: loop unrolling followed by svn
1: svn followed by loop unrolling
2: loop unrolling 
3: svn

The program will require user specifying the input file with only prefix.
i.e. if you have a file 'algred.i' reside in local directory, then the input file name should be 'algred'. Assuming you would like to apply optimization strategy 0 (loop unrolloing followed by svn), you can expect an output file with name 'algred_unroll_svn.i' generated in the local folder,(you will also see intermediate file 'algred_unroll.i' yet 'algred_unroll_svn.i' would be the one used for similator). Similarly, should you apply optimization strategy 3(svn) for 'algred.i', the output file will be 'algred_svn.i'
